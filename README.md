# cleardemand-heatmaps
This repository contains the code used to create an interactive bokeh heatmap for cleardemand data.

This code runs off Bokeh 0.12.13, which can be installed from Bokeh's documentation [here](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html)

Once bokeh is installed, data must be stored in the base directory in a csv file. The code defaults to looking to a file called "PriceBook.csv" on the path. To generate the heatmap, run

`bokeh serve --show heatmap`

from the repository's root directory. This will open a web page with the interactive heatmap.

## heatmap
This folder contains the code to run the heatmap app through Bokeh. It can be run
by entering the command

`bokeh serve --show heatmap`

from the main directory, assuming it can access a csv file called 'PriceBook.csv'.

### heatmap.py
This file contains the two classes used by the heatmap
- HeatGrid -- class used to store the data which will populate the heatmap
- HeatMap -- class used to store display options for the heatmap

### main.py
This file is run to generate and populate the bokeh heatmap application. It builds the tools used for display, and instantiates the heatmap objects
